Summary: After realising that my django-powered site was running on a dangerously old version of django, I've decided to relaunch the site using pelican.

After realising that my django-powered site was running on a dangerously old version of django, I've decided to relaunch the site using [pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.2/index.html), a python static site generation framework. I reason that if it's good enough for django legend [Daniel Roy Greenfeld](http://www.pydanny.com/my-new-blog.html) it's good enough for me.

Most of the old posts aren't up yet, and I'm currently using a prepackaged theme, but I'm going to be working on adding the old content and writing my own pelican theme so that the site ends up looking like the old one. I'll also be adding disqus comments in the fullness of time, or working out a way of hosting my own comments.

Â¡Hasta pronto!
