Here's a simple javascript todo list application, which I created as an exercise in javascript MVC without a framework.

It is influenced by `this article <http://alexatnet.com/articles/model-view-controller-mvc-javascript>`_. However, it differs by making each todo list item its own MVC triad.

The source code is `on github <https://github.com/samfrances/todo-mvc-demo>`_.

I may explain the code in a later post.
