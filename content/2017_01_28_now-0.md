Working on:

- Lots of interesting stuff for [Cydar](https://cydarmedical.com/), involving things like Django Rest Framework, Celery, Ansible, and AWS

Other things:

- I'm getting back into studying Spanish after a few months off.
- I have ordered a running machine! This way I can exercise in my pyjamas while watching Netflix. My plan is to make exercise so convenient that I can't find an excuse not to do it.
